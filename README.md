# DrumKit
I developed the Drum Kit Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating an engaging platform for virtual drumming. Users can enjoy realistic drum sounds and easy-to-use controls via keyboard or mouse clicks. By focusing on frontend design and smooth audio integration, the site exemplifies my skills in web development .
